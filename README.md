#Quiz Game

**Description**
This project is my final submission for CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python. This is a simple command-line quiz game where you can practice answering multiple-choice questions from different categories. I made it because I wanted a fun and easy way to test my knowledge and also add my own custom questions.

The app comes with a few sample questions and answers in questions.json, but you can also add your own questions and categories. It has a menu where you can choose to play a quiz from a specific category or add new questions. When you play, it shows you questions one by one, gives you multiple-choice options, and tells you if your answer is correct. At the end, it shows you your score. The Quiz Game is a Python-based, command-line application designed to help users practice and test their knowledge in a fun way. This project was developed as the final submission for CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python and uses simple Python concepts like loops, lists, dictionaries, randomization, file handling, and JSON management.
The motivation behind this project was to build an interactive tool that can be used for learning, practicing, and even for entertainment. It’s fully customizable, easy to expand, and works offline.

**Files**
quiz.py - the main Python program (menu system, quiz logic, add questions, etc.).
questions.json - the data file that stores quiz questions and answers organized by category.
requirements.txt - lists any needed packages (only standard libraries are used here).
README.md - this file with project information.

**Installation**
You just need Python to run this. No external libraries are required (everything uses Python’s built-in modules). If you use a virtual environment, you don’t need to install anything extra — the requirements.txt file is basically empty.

**How to Run**
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the folder containing these files.
Run the program with:
python quiz.py
